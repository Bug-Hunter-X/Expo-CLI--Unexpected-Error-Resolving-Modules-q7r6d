This error typically occurs when using the Expo CLI with a project that has a misconfiguration in its `package.json` file, specifically concerning dependencies related to React Native and Expo modules.  For example, there might be version conflicts between different packages, or a dependency might be missing altogether. Another possibility is an issue with the project's Metro bundler configuration, which is responsible for compiling the JavaScript code.  Incorrectly configured `metro.config.js` can lead to this error.  Finally, problems with the installation process of Expo itself or its associated libraries on your system can also contribute.
