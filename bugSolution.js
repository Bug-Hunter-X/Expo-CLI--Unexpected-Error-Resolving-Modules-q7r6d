The solution involves systematically checking for and resolving dependency issues.  First, inspect your `package.json` for conflicting versions or missing dependencies. Use `npm ls` or `yarn why` to analyze the dependency tree.  Consider reinstalling packages using `npm install` or `yarn install`. If you have a custom `metro.config.js`, review its settings to ensure they are consistent with Expo's requirements. If the problem persists, try clearing the Expo cache using `expo prebuild --clean` and reinstalling Expo CLI itself.
